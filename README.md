# Cartooning-an-Image-using-Machine-Learning
This the first project I have done on data science. An image is taken and a cartoon effect is applied using the python libraries.
 
 I have published a blog on this project in https://hashnode.com/.
 
 The link to the blog is https://technologyhandy.hashnode.dev/cartoonizing-an-image-using-machine-learning.
